# AlphaGo-Zero-on-Connect4
## Using the AlphaGo Zero algorithm, a reinforcement learning agent learns to play conncet 4

I saw the implementation of AlphaGo Zero by yichen914, and decided to reimplement it by myself. 
I also modified some algorithms in the environment and some parameters to speed up learning.
After 3 days, the agent beat me 7-3 over the courses of 10 games! Two possibles explainations: Either
I am very dumb on connect 4 (which is the most plausible explaination) or the agent just learns faster
than I expected.

Here's the link to the original repository. You'll also find a very detailed explaination of how AlphaGo
Zero works:
